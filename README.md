## 2. Description: 
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

This project is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. So, this project utilized `Express.js` for routing, a `MongoDB` database, and the `Mongoose` ODM. 

## 3. Installation:
